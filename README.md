# Sustainability e-Commerce Platform

This is a web-based e-commerce system developed as part of the **CTIS256 - Introduction to Backend Development** course at Bilkent University. The project focuses on reducing food waste by enabling markets to sell products nearing their expiration dates at discounted prices.

## 🌍 Project Idea

Every year, tons of products are wasted due to expiration. This system provides a win-win solution for both markets and consumers by:
- Helping markets list soon-to-expire products with discounts
- Allowing consumers to purchase these products at lower prices
- Promoting sustainability by reducing waste

## 👥 User Types

- **Market Users**
  - Sign up and manage market info
  - Add/edit/delete discounted products
  - Expired products automatically flagged
- **Consumer Users**
  - Sign up and manage personal info
  - Search for products (keyword-based, filtered by location, non-expired)
  - Add/update/delete items in cart (AJAX enabled)
  - Purchase functionality that clears cart and removes products
